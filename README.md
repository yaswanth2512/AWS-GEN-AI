 Building Generative AI (GenAI) applications using Amazon SageMaker and Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) is an exciting endeavor. Let’s dive into the details:

Amazon SageMaker JumpStart:
Amazon SageMaker JumpStart provides foundation models (FMs) pre-trained on massive amounts of data. These FMs, such as Stable Diffusion, FLAN-T5, and LLaMa-2, can be adapted to various workloads like content creation and text summarization1.
You can fine-tune and deploy these FMs to Amazon SageMaker Endpoints for inference from SageMaker Studio.
Streamlit for User Interaction:
Streamlit, an open-source Python library, allows data scientists and engineers to build and deploy web applications for machine learning and data science projects with minimal coding.
Business users can easily explore or verify foundation models using Streamlit’s web-based user interface.
Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate:
Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestrator that makes it easy to run containerized applications securely and at scale.
